                    <h2 class="title">Why Study Information technology at <strong>RMIT Online?</strong></h2>						
				    	<div class="title">
						<h2><strong>What is my interest in IT? </strong></h2>
					</div>
<p>I enjoy problem solving and using technology, and at it’s core IT is about using technology to find and implement solutions for human problems. Through the course of my work in the NSW public service I became interested in systems analysis and process design, databases, and user experience.</p> 
<p>I’m also a musician, and I use IT tools to:</p>
<p><li><b>Record music</b> - A home studio with a PC to record and edit music. With <a href="https://youtu.be/YTLQnlN_u50?t=56" target="_blank" >Virtual Studio Instruments (VSI)</a> I can make any kind of sound I want.</li>
    <li><b>Perform live</b> - My devices communicate to each other via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI"target="_blank">MIDI</a> and give me a big sound for a one-man show. I use a <a href="https://www.boss.info/au/products/rc-505/"target="_blank">Boss RC-505</a> loop machine, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhaMsKb77_4"target="_blank">Novation Ultranova</a> synthesizer, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa7W8P_PkAY"target="_blank">BeatBuddy</a> drum machine, and a <a href="https://www.boss.info/au/products/gt-100/"target="_blank">Boss GT-100</a> guitar FX unit.</li>
<li><b>Write sheet music or learn new music</b> - <a href="https://www.guitar-pro.com/en/index.php?pg=guitar-pro"target="_blank">GuitarPro</a> &#x2764;</li>
    <li><b>Teach</b> - I share lesson material, backing tracks, and sheet music with my students using <a href="https://drive.google.com"target="_blank">Google Drive</a>.</li></p>				
<br>
                        <div class="title">
						<h2><strong>When did my interest in IT start? </strong></h2>
                    </div>
                        
<p>My dad bought a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64"target="_blank">Commodore C64</a> when I was 8 or so, and I was immediately obsessed with it. Early on I mainly played games on it, but since it had a version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> baked into the operating system I started to learn programming. I bought magazines with my pocket money that had pages of code that you typed in by hand. I noticed functions in the code and ‘borrowed’ them for my own programming projects.</p>

<p>By the mid-1990’s I had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" target="_blank">Amiga</a> computers which I used for school homework, games, coding, music production, and creating bitmap graphics.</p><br>

                    <div class="title">
						<h2><strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest?</strong></h2>
                    </div>
<p>Lenny is a friend of my Dad. He's an industrial electronics technician. Circa 1993 he introduced me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_synthesizer" target="_blank">analog</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis" target="_blank">FM</a> sound synthesis, MIDI sequencing, and so many other things. He's an inspirational guy who travelled across the African continent in a Volkswagen Beetle during the 1970's.</p>                  
                    <div class="title">
						<h2><strong>Any IT experience?</strong></h2>
                    </div>
    
    <p>I've always been the 'tech guy' in the workplace, but I used to call myself an 'expert user' rather than an 'expert in IT'. A about ten years ago I decided I wanted to understand what was happening under the hood of a modern PC, so I started learning Linux/GNU. With help from the lovely people in the <a href="https://ubuntuforums.org/" target="_blank" >Ubuntu Forums,</a> I installed <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" >Ubuntu Linux</a> on a laptop and learnt about using the command line and the principles of Linux and GNU. When I was confident enough, I built a <a href="images/20200526_134543.jpg"target="_blank" target="_blank">NAS</a> as a test bed for server based applications, and as a home for my digital life. </p> 
    <p>My home IT setup looks like this:</p> 

<ul>
    <li>A dual monitor desktop running Windows 10</li>
    <li>A laptop running <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank" >Linux Mint</a></li>
    <li>A NAS running an <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS" target="_blank" >Ubuntu LTS</a></li>
    <li>A few <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" >Raspberry Pi </a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">SBC</a>'s</li>
</ul>                    

                    <div class="title">
						<h2><strong>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?  </strong></h2>
					</div>
    
    <p>I transitioned out of the corporate environment to a career as a <a href="https://facebook.com/thereedman/" target="_blank" >saxophonist and guitarist</a> around two years ago, but the current <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/" target="_blank" >COVID crisis</a> made me consider other options. I decided that studying the introduction courses for a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT would be a positive move for me.</p><br>
                    <div class="title">
						<h2><strong>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</strong></h2>
					</div>
                    

<p>I expect that by studying the Introduction to Information Technology course I will learn some of the skills of the IT professional and have a fuller understanding of the industry and the toolset. I’ve learnt a lot about website design and html by completing this website (my first assignment). The second assignment task will help me learn more about collaborating with group members (who may be physically located all over the world) using tools like Git. The third and fourth assignment tasks are about developing a project as a team. This will help me learn entrepreneurial skills of developing projects and pitching them to clients and investors.</p>

						<h2><strong>Network and System Administrator</strong></h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>My attitude to opportunity is similar to Richard Branson’s. In 2017 he said on his blog <blockquote cite="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/y-yes"> <i>“If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes – then learn how to do it later.”</i> <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/y-yes" target="_blank" ><sup>2</sup></a></blockquote>.
                    <p>I don't know what opportunities are waiting for me in the future, but I know that an IT degree from RMIT will help me make the most of them. There are many different potential career opportunities that I'd be interested in. From being a founder in a start up, to leading a project management team for a corporate, I wouldn't rule anything out....</p>
                    
                    <p>...but a Network and System Administrator is the unsung hero of the 21st Century. They maintain and repair the IT infrastructure of a business or organisation under great pressure at times. If business critical functions like online sales go offline, then a business may lose revenue. If a banks' software and hardware infrastructure <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/cba-runs-ai-over-230000-words-of-asic-regulation-539687" target="_blank" >fail to meet statutory requirements</a><sup>4</sup>, then penalties of up to <a href="https://www.austrac.gov.au/austrac-and-cba-agree-700m-penalty" target="_blank" >$700 million</a><sup>5</sup> can be incurred. The stakes are high at times!</p>
                    <p>I like the idea of caring for an IT system. Keeping it running and in optimal condition. I like the idea of forward planning and change management too. Designing and implementing new solutions for problems.</p>
                    <p>The experience I gained by building and running a Linux server at home was a great start, but the job description says that the servers and virtual machines are Windows based. I understand the Windows desktop well, but I haven't used Windows server before. I'd need more knowledge about networking before I could consider applying for this role. Completing a Bachelor of Information Technology should give me the skills and experience I need to succeed in this role.</p>

<blockquote>I would teach children music, physics and philosophy; but more importantly music; for in the patterns of music and all the arts, are the keys to learning. – Plato</blockquote>
<p>There are many benefits for kids by learning music. A music education ‘improves confidence, self-expression and fosters creativity.”<a href="assets/music_is_good.pdf" target="_blank" ><sup>6</sup></a> Unfortunately many Australian kids don’t get a quality music education at school.<a href="assets/music_is_good.pdf" target="_blank" ><sup>6</sup></a> From my ten years of experience as a music tutor I know that even if kids are given the opportunity to learn a musical instrument they may resist. Kids have told me that they couldn’t make a connection between the instrument they are learning and the music they hear on Spotify, and for those used to <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235088" target="_blank" > instant digital gratification</a>, the learning curve of a traditional musical instrument can be too steep. Thus, restricting music education to traditional musical instruments can be counter-productive. The dictionary definition of a musical instrument is “Anything that is used to produce music”<a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/musical-instrument" target="_blank" ><sup>7</sup></a>, so why should we limit kids creativity to the musical instruments of centuries past?

<p>Most modern music producers use a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and Virtual Studio Instruments (VSI) to create their art, but there are very few accessible options available for young musicians to learn how to use these. There are commercial products available that meet some of the needs of young people, for example, Garage Band is free to users of iOS and MacOS<a href="https://www.apple.com/au/mac/garageband/" target="_blank" ><sup>8</sup></a>, but the cost of an Apple device can be prohibitive which makes it less accessible<a href="https://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-grey-2.6ghz-6-core-processor-512gb/" target="_blank" ><sup>9</sup></a>. The Volca series of retro-inspired synths and samplers are more affordable<a href="https://www.korg-volca.com/en/" target="_blank" ><sup>10</sup></a>, but are less attractive to digital natives. There are also DIY projects which include some of the proposed feature set of Minor Maestro, but need a level of expertise to construct, and are not part of a coherent platform.</p>

<h2>The features</h2>
<li><b>Made for digital natives</b> - A digital first environment for young music producers.</li><br>
<li><b>Educational</b> - Users will learn music theory as they explore the functions and create their own music. Video lessons on a video sharing site like Youtube will help young music producers unlock their creativity. Using the included MIDI keyboard controller or an e-drum kit (sold separately) will take their music learning to the next level.</li><br>
<li><b>Affordable</b> - A starter kit should cost no more than AUD$250 and include the Minor Maestro and a MIDI keyboard.</li><br>
<li><b>Accessible</b> - Young people can start making music with the Minor Maestro starter kit. Minor Maestro will plug into any TV or monitor with a HDMI port. Integration with free services like sample websites will provide plenty of sounds, beats, and grooves for users to work with.</li><br>
<li><b>Portable</b> - With a Power Maestro battery pack and a touchscreen (both sold separately) users can make music anywhere.</li><br>
<li><b>Modular and Extendable</b> - Users can buy extra components to extend the usability. eg. MIDI controllers, microphones, touch screen, DAC, amplifier, sound banks, effects, VST's, etc. </li><br>
<li><b>Piano and Forte</b> - The audio produced by the Minor Maestro can be monitored using headphones, or heard by everyone through a bluetooth speaker or PA system!</li><br>
<li><b>Drive engagement</b> - With gamified tutorials, badges and achievements, users will want to show off to their friends. Promoting popular music producers' through the platform will inspire young people to create their own works of art.</li><br>
<li><b>Open source</b> - Minor Maestro will be built on an optimised Linux stack. Existing open source software will be used as much as possible. A coherent hardware/software platform with well defined API’s will allow users to extend the features, and allows for third party products and services to be integrated.</li><br>
<li><b>Built for sharing and collaboration</b> - Minor Maestro will use git to enable users to share and collaborate on music projects. Free hosting for users projects and file sharing using a hosted git repository. Git branches will allow users to download a copy of a friends song to re-mix it and re-share. Git history will show edits made by different people. There are licensing opportunities for the users material in broadcast or re-use in a commerical setting. Git commit histories could be used to distribute these royalties fairly.</li><br>
<li><b>Cross platform streaming</b> - Dedicated streaming apps on Android, iOS, Windows 10, PS4, XBoxOne, ChromeCast, etc. Ad supported or premium streaming is a possible revenue source for users music.</li><br>
<li><b>Off-the-shelf components</b> - The core Minor Maestro device will be based on an ARM series processor, and fabricated using existing components. This will keep production and development costs down.</li><br>
<li><b>Fast</b> - Using compiled binaries optimised for the hardware platform, the Minor Maestro will be fast and responsive.</li><br>

<h2>The team</h2>
<li><b>The hardware</b> - Finding the right balance between  ‘cost to the user’ vs ‘benefit to the user’ is a tricky one. Designing the device, and selecting all the components needs the skills of an engineer with experience in designing and proto-typing ARM based devices.</li><br>
<li><b>The platform</b> - Creating the platform for users to log in and store their work with git is a job for someone with server-side programming experience.</li><br>
<li><b>A coherent UI</b> - This will need someone with UX design experience.</li><br>
<li><b>DAW software</b> - The existing open source code that will be incorporated into Minor Maestro needs work done to improve UX and be optimised for the hardware stack. That will need a programmer with experience in low level languages.</li><br>

<h2>The outcome</h2>
<p>Kids will get all the benefits of learning music and music production using a low upfront cost device. The Minor Maestro will encourage a new generation of musicians to create and share their work with their peers and to a worldwide audience. Any work submitted to the platform becomes available for users of the Minor Maestro to download and re-mix, and is available on a streaming service to reach a wider audience. Young producers may earn revenue from the streaming service and use of their work in advertising. This may drive user engagement even further.</p>
